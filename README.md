### Industry Insights: The Future of RecSys

Based on recent advances from RecSys 2025 and KDD 2025, two major trends are reshaping recommendation systems:

**1. Generative Recommendations**
- LLMs enable users to express needs in natural language, moving beyond implicit signals
- Addresses long-tail content and cold-start through semantic understanding
- Enables conversational AI recommendation assistants

**2. Multimodal Integration**
- Unified understanding of social media posts, comments, shopping reviews, and UGC/non-UGC content
- Cross-modal retrieval for richer user preference modeling

**Key Lesson**: While sophisticated algorithms are powerful, simple heuristics (e.g., "recommend 3 more posts from this creator") can sometimes outperform complex models. Success requires deep insight into user behavior and product characteristics, not just algorithmic sophistication.

## ü§ñ Agentic AI: Domain-Specific Automation

### Agentic Variant Curator for Precision Medicine

**[PhasedVariants_AgenticCurator](https://github.com/arcadianlyric/PhasedVariants_AgenticCurator)** | Genomics Pipeline Enhancement

**Challenge**: Genetic variant curation‚Äîconnecting genotype to phenotype‚Äîrequires extensive manual interpretation by skilled curators to extract biological and clinical meaning from phased VCF files. This process is time-consuming, limits throughput, and suffers from inter-curator variability.

**Solution**: A true agentic AI system integrating planning, reflection, and multi-agent collaboration to automate variant curation with RAG-enhanced analysis.

**Agentic Architecture**:

1. **Planning Agent**
   - Automatic task decomposition into 5-7 atomic, actionable steps
   - Dynamic agent assignment based on analysis goals (comprehensive, disease-focused, variant-focused)
   - Dependency management ensuring sequential knowledge building

2. **Multi-Agent Collaboration** (7 Specialized Agents)
   - **Literature Retrieval Agent**: Multi-source search (PubMed + GeneCards + arXiv + Tavily) with progressive query strategy
   - **Vector Store Agent**: FAISS index creation and semantic search management
   - **RAG Analysis Agent**: Retrieval-augmented generation with literature context
   - **Knowledge Graph Agent**: PrimeKG queries for gene-disease-pathway relationships
   - **Variant Curator Agent**: Genetic variant impact analysis
   - **Reflection Agent**: Quality assessment and gap identification
   - **Report Generator Agent**: Comprehensive clinical report synthesis

3. **Reflection & Quality Control**
   - Automated scoring on 5 dimensions: completeness, accuracy, evidence support, clarity, clinical utility
   - Hallucination detection flagging unsupported claims
   - Iterative refinement (up to 2 iterations) based on reflection feedback

4. **Multi-Source Literature Retrieval**
   - **Progressive Search Strategy**:
     - Level 1: gene + disease + variant (most specific)
     - Level 2: gene + disease OR gene + variant
     - Level 3: gene only (fallback)
   - **Hallucination Reduction**: Tavily provides grounded, fact-checked web information
   - **Query Transparency**: Each result includes `query_used` field for reproducibility

**Agentic Workflow Pipeline**:
```
Planning ‚Üí Execution (Multi-Agent) ‚Üí Reflection ‚Üí Refinement ‚Üí Report
```

**Key Advantages Over Basic RAG**:
- ‚úÖ Structured planning vs. ad-hoc queries
- ‚úÖ 7 specialized agents vs. single monolithic agent
- ‚úÖ 4 complementary sources (PubMed + GeneCards + arXiv + Tavily) vs. single source
- ‚úÖ Progressive search with automatic fallback
- ‚úÖ Built-in quality control and iterative improvement

**Tech Stack**: LangChain, FAISS, OpenAI GPT-4, PubMed API, GeneCards, arXiv, Tavily, PrimeKG
